                        <p> The union of a team is the strength needed to overcome obstacles. In a given stretch of
                            the river, a distance of approximately 2 to 3 minutes is run. The team that covers the
                            given distance in the shortest time wins the race.
                            It consists of the competition of two rafting rafts facing each other. They start at the
                            same time, one on each side of the river. This competition takes place on the same
                            course as the previous test, with the difference that there are 4 buoys in the river,
                            2 on the left side and 2 on the right side. Each team must choose 1 buoy from each
                            side and pass it correctly. In this way, the team that passes the buoys correctly and
                            arrives first at the finish line wins the leg. The winning team will continue competing
                            in the next heats until they reach the final heat and win the discipline.</p>

                            They run approximately 8 to 12 kilometers downriver. All the rafts start at the same
                            time (depending on the category) and the first team to reach the finish line is the
                            winner of the discipline. This is the test in which the technical skill of each team
                            is demonstrated. In a given stretch, between 8 and 14 "gates" are placed in the river.
                            These gates must be passed, some downstream, some upstream. If a team touches a gate,
                            5 seconds are added to their final time, and if they miss the gate, 50 seconds are added
                            to their final time once the circuit is completed.</p>
